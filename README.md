# Diagnosis-of-heart-disease-using-feature-selection
 In this project, a neural network-based genetic algorithm is used to diagnose heart disease using wrapper reduction. A combination of these techniques is used to manage the data set with dimensions and uncertainty that the data is obtained from the uci heart disease data set These data are classified based on different uses. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method has reached 79% accuracy.
