# Diagnosis-of-heart-disease-using-feature-selection
Heart disease is one of the most complicated diseases, and it affects a large number of individuals throughout the world. In healthcare, particularly cardiology, early and accurate detection of cardiac disease is critical. The Heart Disease Data Set-UCI repository collects data on heart disease. The search space and complexity of the classification models are increased by this raw dataset, which contains redundant and inconsistent data. We need to eliminate the redundant and unnecessary elements from the data to improve classification accuracy. As a consequence, feature selection approaches might be useful for reducing the cost of diagnosis by identifying the most important qualities. This research developed an ensemble classification model based on a feature selection approach in which selected features play a role in classification. Accordingly, a classification approach was introduced using ensemble learning with a genetic algorithm, feature selection, and biomedical test values to diagnose heart disease. Based on the results, it is deduced that the benefits of using the feature selection method vary depending on the utilized machine learning technique. However, the best-proposed model based on the combination of genetic algorithm and the ensemble learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.57% on the considered datasets. The suggested diagnosis system achieved better accuracy than previously proposed methods and can easily be implemented in healthcare to identify heart disease.   



<h2> Dataset </h2>
This study, the data set of heart patients available in (HTTP:// archive.ics.uci.edu/ ml / datasets/ statlog +(heart) has been used, which has 13 useful variables and 270 records. These variables and abbreviations are listed in Table 3. 75% of the data is for training, and 25% of the data is for testing 


<h2> Methods </h2>
We now describe the datasets we chose, the algorithms used, and the experimental methodology.  They have been used for different research purposes in recent years. Such datasets may contain thousands of instances (records), each represented by hundreds or thousands of features (attributes or variables). The large datasets have many features, including valuable data for understanding information and many inappropriate and related features. This decreases learning achievement and computational performance. So, a preprocessing step named "feature selection" is used to reduce the dimensions before using any information extraction techniques such as classification, related rules, clustering, and regression [49]. A feature selection technique was proposed to pick a subset of relevant and non-redundant features in this study to overcome these problems. To this end, the genetic algorithm and the Relief and FCBF are employed to pick the valuable features in the rapid diagnosis of heart diseases. Our work attempts to predict diagnosis efficiently with a reduced number of features (i.e., attributes) that contribute more towards cardiac disease detection using the feature selection technique. The structure is shown in Fig. 1.

<h2> Conlusion </h2>

As mentioned, one of the most common chronic diseases and causes of adult death worldwide is heart disease [50]. According to the Health Announcement, Medical Education Department: 33 to 38% of deaths in the country are due to cardiovascular diseases, and Iran has the highest rate of heart death in the world. Changes in people's lifestyles increase the prevalence of heart disease in Iran. Evidence for lifestyle changes shows that the prevalence of the cardiovascular disease is increasing in Iran.
It is calculable that by 2020, the mortality caused by these diseases can increase to 25 million. Artificial intelligence has many applications in medicine, including forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 [74], diabetes [45], cancer [46], heart [75], and Covid-19 [76]. This article used an ensemble learning method based on a genetic algorithm to select valuable features in the immediate diagnosis of heart disease. The results show the high efficiency of the suggested approach in diagnosing heart disease with 97.57% accuracy. 
As a suggestion for future research, the Naive Bayesian method, decision tree, or support vector regression can be used as a classifier model, and its combination with the new approach to select a combination feature extracted from this study can be used to diagnose and predict metastatic diseases of breast cancer, lung cancer, Covid-19 and various diseases.
